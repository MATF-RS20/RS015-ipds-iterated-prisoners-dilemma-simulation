# IPDS UML

All collaborators are obliged to update the diagram with their changes.

We are keeping UML in 3 ways:

* .io file - can be opened via [online drawing app](https://www.draw.io/)
* app linked with [Google drive file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4iq0OFqT1oZxxgdLQ2GKWz6Wz2Mibso/view?usp=sharing) - anyone with the link can see it, but not edit it
* .png file in the project itself - will probably be updated less often
